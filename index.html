            My name is Joshua Lishman, I am 21 years old. My student number is s3829198 and my RMIT email is s3829198@student.rmit.com.au. . I am half British, on my fathers’ side and half Australian, on my mothers’ side. My highest level of completed education is the completion of year 12 but I also have completed a Certificate 3 in Information Technology and 1 and a half years of a Bachelor of Business before moving into my current student of IT. I can speak partial Indonesian from multiple years of studying it through primary and into high school. I played Rugby League for many years, from under 7’s all the way to under 15’s where I had my leg broken in a tackle and wasn’t able to play again but I still follow it closely when I can and still to this day wish I could get back out on that field for another game.

            <p>My name is Kevin Brown, I am 49 years old my student ID s3831353 and can contact me on my  email s3831353@student.rmit.edu.au.  from a young age I was a practicing escape artist from the time I could walk, I managed to escape from my cot without success and broken my collar bone not once but twice and then when I was fifteen. I managed to break in again and have some of my collar bone removed and my hip bone put in place this was in  Randwick which was a beautiful place to grow up in  Sydney,  from the age of eight the family business was commercial bakeries and factories which was this big part of my life and  I am a qualified baker by trade which became allergy flour later in life. I started managing small retail chains and develop my career in management. I have three beautiful kids, and when my son was born, I had to take a break from my career and look after him as he use to stop break 30 times a night and finally got the all-clear when he was one and a half years old, after that, I landed a job as a casual orderly, and I have worked my way up to a senior orderly. As a senior orderly a meet a lot of people at the worst time of their lives and some of the best time of their lives, and it makes you look at your life in a whole new light.

              Name: Tegan, Student Number: S3831038. I was born in Australia to Australian parents and have completed certificates II to IV in Information Technology. Due to my health, I enjoy low impact activities with my hobbies including sewing and PC gaming. My health is also the reason I change career paths form hospitality to IT. I have worked as in-house IT at a local not-for-profit with my key roles including network admin, end-user support and IT maintenance.
