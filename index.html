                  My name is Joshua Lishman, I am 21 years old and my student number is s3829198. I am half British, on my father’s side and half Australian, on my mother’s side. My highest level of completed education is the completion of year 12 but I also have completed a Certificate 3 in Information Technology and 1 and a half years of a Bachelor of Business before moving into my current study of IT. I can speak some Indonesian from multiple years of study through primary and into high school. I played rugby league for many years, from under 7s all the way to under 15s where I had my leg broken in a tackle and couldn’t play again, but I still follow it closely when I can and still to this day wish I could get back out on that field for another game.

                  My name is Kevin Brown, I am 49 years old and my student ID s3831353. I am a qualified baker by trade however I developed an allergy to flour later in life. I started managing small retail chains and developing my career in management. I have three beautiful kids, and when my son was born, I had to take a break from my career and look after him as he used to wake 30 times a night. Finally, when he was one and a half years old, I was able to land a job as a casual orderly, and I have worked my way up to a senior orderly. As a senior orderly I meet a lot of people at the worst time of their lives and some of the best time of their lives, and it makes you look at your life in a whole new light.  From a young age I have been interested in computers and have built a few of my own and helped out family and friends, I am a pc gamer and my first computer was a IBM and ever since then being interested in learning to program but never had the courage to pursue a career in IT till now.

                Hi there, my name is Lori and I’m 22, Student ID s3824209. I work at a telco in the small but closely-knit team of the billing department. I get called upon sometimes by others for any IT issues as our main IT department was moved off-site. Hoping to complete this bridging course and degree so I can move into a career centred around cyber security. My hobbies include videogames, reading, Diamond Paint art, music, Formula 1 and working on my make-up skills.

                <p>Lynette Kemp, S3728067.I have a background in accounting, finance and retail management, but have always been the one to fix any IT problems at work and for friends. I did a small amount of IT studies 20 years ago and have since studied in the accounting/finance area but after doing half a Bachelor of Accounting have decided that my interest in IT is where my future lies so I am in the progress of changing degrees. Some of my hobbies include Netball, Basketball, Hiking and gaming on the Xbox, having hobbies my children are also involved in makes it easier to spend time together.

                 The results of these test make me more self-aware of the person I really am and that I should try work on a few elements of my life to try to become a better person. The results show that in a group setting I might not be the one to come up with ideas or speak up when I need to but am able to get the work done on time and efficiently once things have been worked out. To compensate for this, I need to make sure I communicate more effectively in group scenarios and be more comfortable around the people I am in a group with.

                  The last test shows that I am open and honest, clear and consistent when I have a project to complete, and I am agreeable when someone proves their point. When working with a team, I like to be open and honest about the direction or goal that we need to get achieved. I like to assign roles and responsibilities from the start to ensure we get the best out of everyone. I work well when part of a team and I like to get people's views of my work to ensure we are all heading in the right direction, and I will let the team know if we aren’t heading in the right direction to achieve our overall goal or project ideas that we have agreed on.

                These results almost hit the nail on the head to what my Manager had described me. I am told that I wear my heart on my sleeve, which makes sense as I can be emotional, but I do not let that get in the way of any decision making. I try very hard with getting my work done and keeping myself and those in the team positive and happy, always here with welcoming arms for help or support.

                  The description of being very reserved I find to be very true; I make a conscious effort to open up and communicate more but do find that I sometimes can close off. I can be overly sensitive and dislike confrontation but am sensitive to the needs of others. I can be a perfectionists and have to balance this with be able to get things done.

                  I am a very emotional person which can make interactions a challenge, however I also make strong efforts to consider all sides of a situation and like to think of myself as quite intelligent. In a team situation, I find if I communicate my emotional issues, we can put together some excellent work.

                  I tend to come across as cynical and reserved and am prone to the (very) occasional emotional outburst. I prefer to do things alone and often find interacting with people to be a chore. This makes *working* with people very difficult. But I’m high in agreeableness and openness, so I’m good at doing as I’m told. Some people are leaders, others are followers. I am in the latter group.

                <em>With many of the group Introverted we need to ensure we make a conscious effort to speak up and to communicate as a team as these skills may not come naturally.  When it comes to collecting information many of the group are sensing which means they rely on what they can see, feel & hear, they can recall experiences easier. An Intuitive person's ideas are very well thought out. We have thinkers and feelers within the group, which mean some of us think very rationally and logically whilst others think with people in mind, who try to avoid conflict. Judgers prefer decision to be made and are very task oriented, Perceivers prefer to keep things open to be able to innovate and finish last minute.</em>

            <p>
              There are a lot of similarities in our ideal jobs especially Data Engineer, Software Engineer and Full Stack Web Developer; These positions require the principles of computer software to design and develop computer software, with a full stack developer also needing to know more front-end technology. A Cyber Security (Malware) Analysist also needs to know C & C++ similar to the above position to provide access to IT infrastructure such as system processes. The big difference in Cyber Security to other positions is that it is more about monitoring and analysing existing systems and protection of sensitive information.
            </p>
            <p>
              The position of Systems Assembler is the only position within the group that revolves around the hardware of a computer rather than the software, with a thorough understanding of how the different hardware components will meet a customer's needs. This position does require good problem-solving skills which is also required for the other positions.
            </p>
            <p>
              We all seem to have the analytical, logical parts of the industry at the forefront of our aspirations, though this appears to come with the territory, as people with our personality types (introverted, thinking, neurotic types) seem to be drawn to an industry where it is possible to spend a lot of your time in a room making things work without speaking face-to-face with actual human beings.
